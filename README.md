 ðŸŽ­ Real-Time Emotion Detector

This project demonstrates how to build a **real-time emotion detection system** using **Python, OpenCV, and a pre-trained deep learning model**. It captures your webcam feed, detects faces, and predicts emotions with percentage probabilities â€” all running locally on your computer.

---

 ðŸ“š Features

* Detects human faces using **Haarcascade Classifier**
* Predicts **7 emotions**: Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise, Neutral
* Displays a **real-time webcam feed** with emotion labels
* Shows **probability bars** for each detected emotion

---

 ðŸ›  Prerequisites

To run this project, youâ€™ll need:

* Python (3.10 recommended)
* Visual Studio Code (or any IDE)
* A working webcam
* Basic Python knowledge
* Internet (for installing dependencies)

 ðŸªœ How It Works

1. **Face Detection**

   * Uses OpenCVâ€™s Haarcascade to detect faces in real-time.

2. **Emotion Prediction**

   * Extracted face region is passed into a pre-trained **Mini-XCEPTION model**.
   * The model outputs probabilities for 7 different emotions.

3. **Visualization**

   * A bounding box and label (emotion) are drawn on the face.
   * A side panel shows colored bars representing the percentage probability of each emotion.

 ðŸš€ Steps to Run

1. **Set Up Environment**

   * Create a virtual environment inside the project folder.
   * Activate the environment.

2. **Install Dependencies**

   * Install the required Python libraries from `requirements.txt`.

3. **Add Pretrained Model**

   * Place `_mini_XCEPTION.102-0.66.hdf5` in the project folder.

4. **Run the Program**

   * Execute the Python script:

     ```
     python emotion_detector.py
     ```

5. **Test in Real-Time**

   * The webcam opens and shows emotion predictions.
   * Press **Q** to quit the program.
